# Skin-Lesion-Classification-

•	Spearheaded an end-to-end skin cancer detection system using machine learning and amazon services like S3, SageMaker, Lambda, IAM and API Gateway to streamline the analysis of dermatoscopic images.
•	Trained a neural network model using MONAI Pytorch for cancer diagnosis leveraging AWS cloud infrastructure.


** Pytorch model consists of files like:
monai_skin_cancer.ipynb
monai_skin_cancer.py
set.env
skin_cancer_dataset.py
transform_data.ipynb
